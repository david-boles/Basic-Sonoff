# Basic-Sonoff
A basic Arduino program to turn power on and off at a certain time with one of [these](https://www.banggood.com/DIY-Wi-Fi-Wireless-Switch-For-Smart-Home-With-ABS-Shell-p-1019971.html?rmmds=search). Program it through the 5 pin .1" header inside (not populated) with a 3.3v USB to serial converter; pins are, from in (transformer) to out, 3.3v, RX, TX, ground, NC. Press the button and then power it to enter programming mode for initial flashing. It boots into time controlled mode (after connecting to wifi) but you can switch between that (1 flash), on (2 flashes), and off (3 flashes) by pressing the switch.
